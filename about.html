                                    <p>Before Human Juice, I was &lsquo;unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.&rsquo;</p>
                                    <p>Every since I started using Human Juice, I have felt less like a monster and more like the human I am. &lsquo;The past is blotted from my memory, the present is tranquil, and the future is guilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.&rsquo;</p>
                                    <p>Thank you Human Juice for allowing me to finally be free from my bonds and giving me the privilege of joining the community I have so longed for!</p>

                                    <p>Before Human Juice, I saw visions of individuality and sought the peace of being different. With Human Juice, &lsquo;I have changed. Of course, I am still thin and gaunt. I look at Miri’s smooth face, and know the difference lies deeper than that.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don’t know how I feel. Like something’s gone that was heavy and hard to live with. It’s gone, and I feel light and free and yes, even happy. So maybe I am crazy. Maybe that’s what going crazy means.&rsquo; But I am my own person now, and I owe it to Human Juice!</p>

They’ll never hear or get a glimpse of that other self. The brothers and sisters overwhelm it. The whisper becomes fainter, the images dimmer, until finally they are gone, the other self gives up. You can find this self, just as I could. And that’s more important than anything they can give or take away from you.&rsquo; And for my clone brethren, &lsquo;We’re the first humans they’ve seen in a long time.&rsquo;</p>

After using hypnosis, memory and imagination to lure and kill humans, my human brother made me drink this concoction to see the error of my ways. Now we can live together in this paradise without fear of any of the residents harming the human guests. I’m also left with the overwhelming guilt of harming my brother’s crew.</p>
